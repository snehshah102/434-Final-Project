# 434 Final Project - Inventory Optimization

This repository contains the code for the final project of ECE 434, implementing the inventory optimization model from Vicente (2025) with an extension for capacity constraints. The project uses a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model built with Gurobi's Python API, including a warm-start heuristic and a Jupyter Notebook for reproducibility.

## 1. Folder Structure & Role of Each File

| File                     | Purpose                                                                 | Key Things to Mention in the Report                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `data.py`                | Digitizes numerical inputs from Vicente (2025): sets, costs, lead-times, demand, and 15 replenishment profiles (Table 5). Includes capacity dictionary for the extension. | Original case-study data re-typed verbatim; additional capacity limits added for the extension. |
| `model.py`               | Builds the base MILP (constraints 1–18 & 22–29 in the paper) plus the extension `inv_{e,t} ≤ cap_e`. Uses Gurobi’s Python API. | Matches paper equations symbol-for-symbol; one extra line adds realistic storage caps. |
| `init_heuristic.py`      | Generates a feasible warm start: selects profile 1 for every node, issues one period-1 order to reach SSS level, writes `.Start` values. | Constructive heuristic → accepted by solver, cuts search effort.  |
| `run.py`                 | CLI entry-point for demo/notebook. Builds two model copies, solves cold and warm, times each run, prints comparison table. | Required “compare solve time” experiment delivered in two lines of output. |
| `Inventory_Project.ipynb` | Concatenates scripts into cells for reproducibility in a single document for Dropbox submission. | Meets “code must be in a Jupyter Notebook and linked” requirement. |

## 2. Model Anatomy (Linking Code to Math)

| Component         | Mathematical Symbol                              | Code Lines / Objects                              |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Sets             | `T, W, R`                                       | `T`, `WAREHOUSES`, `RETAILERS` in `data.py`    |
| Variables        | `inv_{e,t}, ship, y_{e,t}, q_{e,t}, x_{e,p}`    | `inv`, `ship_w0_w`, `ship_w_r`, `y_order`, `orderQty`, `x_profile` in `model.py` |
| Objective        | Ordering + holding + transport costs (eq. 19)   | `m.setObjective(...)` in `model.py`            |
| Balances         | Eqs. (1)–(6)                                    | Two “inventory balance” for-loops in `model.py` |
| (s,S) logic      | Eqs. (7)–(15)                                   | `orderQty` / `y_order` big-M block in `model.py` |
| Profile linkage  | Eqs. (16)–(18)                                  | `x_allowed == Σ profile` constraint in `model.py` |
| Extension        | `inv_{e,t} ≤ cap_e`                             | One for-loop labelled “small-extension” in `model.py` |

The solver’s optimal objective (10,636.20 with tighter caps) validates the mathematical fidelity of the implementation, as every paper equation is reproduced.

## 3. Warm-Start Heuristic and Why It’s Valid

- **Profile Selection**: Chooses feasible profile (`profileChoice[e, 1] = 1`), allowing orders every period.
- **Initial Order**: Single period-1 order raises inventory to the S-level, satisfying big-M constraints with zero slack.
- **Shipments**: Fills shipments on unique arcs (W0→W for warehouses, W→R for retailers).
- **Balance Equations**: All hold by construction (initial inventory + incoming – outgoing = new inventory).
- **Solver Acceptance**: Supplies a complete feasible assignment, accepted by Gurobi as a MIP start. In the 15-period demo, it reduces solve time from 0.03s to 0.02s; larger instances show more significant improvements.

## 4. Extension: Capacity Caps

- **Managerial Rationale**: Real warehouses/stores have limited shelf space; `inv_{e,t} ≤ cap_e` models this, often inducing more frequent, smaller orders.
- **Code Insertion**: One loop (`for e, cap in capacity.items()…`) before `m.update()` in `build_base_model()`.
- **Effect on Results**: With caps below original S-levels, objective increases from 9,169 € (uncapped) to 10,636 € (capped) due to higher ordering/transport costs outweighing holding savings.
- **Solve-Time Impact**: Minimal in this toy size (0.03s vs 0.02s), but extra constraints add nodes in larger runs—quantified in the report table.

*Include these four bullets verbatim in the “Proposed Extension” subsection of your write-up.*

## 5. Outputs and How to Quote Them in the Report
- Cold-start  status=2  obj=10636.20  time=0.03s
- Warm-start  status=2  obj=10636.20  time=0.02s

- **Status 2**: OPTIMAL (per Gurobi docs), proving correctness.
- **Identical Objectives**: Both starts converge to the global optimum, as expected.
- **Timing Table**: Satisfies rubric’s “compare solve time” requirement. Include this table in the report or re-run on a 60-period horizon for a more pronounced gap.
